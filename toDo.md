- continuing will get me able to test and have a modularized code base


- start to take every function out of main and into it's own file to be imported to main.js and to be tested as well. 
- separate the tests into different files that handle different functionality ie. the sequence stuff the state handling functions...

- need to start on the styling
- thinking of moving the panels around after every couple of rounds
