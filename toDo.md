- look at why browserify and uglify do not work with gulp task.
- however the way the sequence.js and main.js files are they are working they way I want them to export and import functions around... 
- continuing will get me able to test and have a modularized code base


- start to take every function out of main and into it's own file to be imported to main.js and to be tested as well. 
- separate the tests into different files that handle different functionality ie. the sequence stuff the state handling functions...
